Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of a line segment and circle in 3D.
The program first checks if either of the end-points lie within the circle (which is stationary), if so, collision is detected.
If neither of the end-points are inside the circle, then it check for the closest point to the circle's center, which also lies on the line,
and checks if that point lies inside the circle. If so, collision is detected else not.
Use Mouse to move in x-y plane, and "w and s" to move in z axis.
